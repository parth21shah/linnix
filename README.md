# Linnix

**Find which process is hurting your SLOs — not just who's using CPU, but who's causing stalls.**

## The Problem

`top` shows 80% CPU. Prometheus shows high latency. But *which pod* is actually stalling your payment service?

Linnix uses **eBPF** + **PSI (Pressure Stall Information)** to answer this. PSI measures actual stall time — not usage, but contention. A pod using 40% CPU with 60% PSI is worse than one using 100% CPU with 5% PSI.

**What Linnix detects:**
- **Noisy Neighbors**: Which container is starving others
- **Fork Storms**: Runaway process creation before it crashes the node
- **Stall Attribution**: "Pod X caused 300ms stall to Pod Y"
- **PSI Saturation**: CPU/IO/Memory pressure that doesn't show in `top`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Monitor-only by default.** Linnix detects and reports — it never takes action without explicit configuration.

### 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **[Security Policy](SECURITY.md)**: See our security model, privileges required, and vulnerability reporting process
- **[Safety Guarantees](SAFETY.md)**: Understand our "Monitor-First" architecture and safety controls
- **[Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)**: System diagram and data flow for security reviews

**Key Promise**: All analysis happens locally. No data leaves your infrastructure unless you explicitly configure Slack notifications. [Learn more about data privacy →](SECURITY.md#data-privacy)

## Quickstart (Kubernetes)

Deploy Linnix as a DaemonSet to monitor your cluster.

```bash
# Apply the manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

**Access the API:**
```bash
kubectl port-forward daemonset/linnix-agent 3000:3000
# API available at http://localhost:3000
# Stream events: curl http://localhost:3000/stream
```

## Quickstart (Docker)

Try it on your local machine in 30 seconds.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linnix-os/linnix.git && cd linnix
./quickstart.sh
```

## How It Works

1.  **Collector (eBPF)**: Sits in the kernel, watching `fork`, `exec`, `exit`, and scheduler events with <1% overhead.
2.  **Reasoning Engine**: Aggregates signals (PSI + CPU + Process Tree) to detect failure patterns.
3.  **Triage Assistant**: When a threshold is breached, Linnix captures the system state and explains the root cause.

### Supported Detections

| Incident Type | Detection Logic | Triage Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Circuit Breaker** | High PSI (>40%) + High CPU (>90%) | Identifies the *specific* process tree causing the stall. |
| **Fork Storm** | >10 forks/sec for 2s | Catches runaway scripts before they crash the node. |
| **Memory Leak** | Sustained RSS growth | Flags containers that will eventually OOM. |
| **Short-lived Jobs** | Rapid exec/exit churn | Identifies inefficient build scripts or crash loops. |

## Safety & Architecture

Linnix is designed for production safety.

*   **Monitor-First**: Enforcement capabilities are opt-in and require explicit configuration.
*   **Low Overhead**: Uses eBPF perf buffers, not `/proc` polling.
*   **Privilege Isolation**: Can run with `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON` on bare metal. Kubernetes DaemonSet currently uses privileged mode for simplicity.

See [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) for our detailed safety model.

## Kubernetes Features

Linnix has first-class Kubernetes support:

- **Pod Attribution**: Every process event is tagged with `pod_name`, `namespace`, `container_id`
- **Namespace Awareness**: Filter and query by namespace
- **PSI Contribution Tracking**: See which pod contributed to system-wide PSI pressure
- **cgroup Integration**: Maps processes to their cgroups for container-level aggregation

```bash
# Example: Get processes causing stalls in the payments namespace
curl "http://localhost:3000/processes?namespace=payments&sort=psi_contribution"
```
